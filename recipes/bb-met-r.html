    <p>Surinamese Brown Beans and Rice (BB and R) are an absolute must in any cookbook about Paramaribo. Alongside pom, it's a dish that simply has to be served at a Creole birthday party. Judith Cyrus, the author of the cookbook 'Paramaribo', explains how this version of BB and R ended up in her book. 'I'm a big fan of using chicken with bones. Bones simply add extra flavor to your dishes. That also goes for BB and R. But I can't ignore the fact that there are tons of people who prefer chicken breast; partly because the breast is easier to handle (no messing around with bones) and partly because the breast contains less fat.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>400 g chicken</li>
        <li>1 pot of brown beans</li>
        <li>75 g zoutvlees boiled</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Tomato purée</li>
        <li>2 seeded and diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>4 allspice berries</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>2 stalks of celery, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 vegetable bouillon cube</li>
        <li>½ tsp ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 can (400g) Vienna sausages, drained</li>
        <li>1 Madame Jeanette pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sweet soy sauce (optional)</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Zoutvlees unsalting</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If there's a fatty part on the meat, feel free to trim it off after boiling. The fat helps make it tender.</li>
        <li>Give the meat a quick rinse. Then, pop it into a pot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil and simmer for about an hour.</li>
        <li>The meat is ready to use once you can easily cut through it with a knife. It shouldn't fall apart though. Cut it into 75-100 gram portions and let it cool before freezing.</li>
        <li>While salt meat gives your dish a boost of flavor, it doesn't replace regular salt. Make sure to taste your food before serving to see if it needs any extra salt.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>BB en R preparing</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Clean the chicken and pat it dry. Season the chicken liberally with salt and pepper. Let it marinate for a bit. Drain the brown beans, saving the liquid. Add water to the liquid until you have half a liter.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a wok or deep pan and brown the chicken and salt meat. Stir-fry the garlic and onion for 3 minutes. Fry the tomato paste for 1 minute. Stir in the tomatoes and drained brown beans and stir-fry briefly. Add the allspice berries, bay leaf, celery, bouillon cube, nutmeg, sugar, sausages, and the bean liquid topped up with water.</li>
        <li>Simmer everything, covered, over low heat for 45 minutes. After 35 minutes, add the habanero pepper and, if desired, the soy sauce. Taste and season with salt and black pepper. Before serving, remove the habanero pepper and be careful not 'bos' (to burst the pepper in Suriname slang).</li>
        <li>Serve with Surinamese rice (or Basmati rice), pickled vegetables, fried plantain, and a side of sweet and spicy chili sauce.</li>
    </ol>
